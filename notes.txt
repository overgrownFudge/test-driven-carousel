Enzyme definition: 
Airbnb’s Enzyme has become the most popular library for testing React components. 
Enzyme is especially good at rendering a single component in isolation, a technique known as “shallow rendering,” 
and letting you see how changes in the component’s props and state cause its render tree to change.
